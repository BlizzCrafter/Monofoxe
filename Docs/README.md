# Documentation!

You are entering the documentation zone. In the docs you'll find information on how to work with Monofoxe.

You're expected to know:

- C# on an entry level.
- Basics of OOP.
- At least five different fox species.

Docs will not describe each and every function of Monofoxe. For that you'll need to look in the source code -- don't worry, it's all described and documented in there. Main purpose of the docs is to tell you how and when to use main features of the engine. 

A good place to start is the [Table of Contents](Contents.md). 

And while you're at it, you might as well learn basics of Monogame [here](http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/monogame-getting-started-tutorials). You can also check out [Monogame forum](http://community.monogame.net/) and [Monogame DIscord](https://discord.gg/ct7GQgW).
