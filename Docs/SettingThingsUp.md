*hehe, you are still here*

Well, it is time to install Monofoxe. Currently Monofoxe only supports development on Windows and Visual Studio, but it should be technically possible to make it run on other operating systems and IDEs. 

- Download Visual Studio 2017 [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes). You can use 2019 or 2015, but I recommend 2017, since 2019 is fairly new.
- After installing Visual Studio and .NET package, download and install [latest Monofoxe release](https://github.com/gnFur/Monofoxe/releases/latest). The installer already comes with Monogame, so you don't need to worry about it. Additionally, Monofoxe will install [NoPipeline](https://github.com/gnFur/NoPipeline), which drastically improves Monogame resource management. 

And that's pretty much it! Now you can open Visual Studio and there you'll see Monofoxe project templates.
