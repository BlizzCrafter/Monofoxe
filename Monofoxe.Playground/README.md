# You are entering the playground!

This is a set of demos which show off basic Monofoxe features and capabilities.



## Setting up

To launch the thing, you need to clone the repository and build Monogame solution is Debug. This will provide Monofoxe libraries which Monofoxe.Playground will use. Then you can open the Playground solution and start it up.

Don't worry, compiling the engine isn't scary. : - )
